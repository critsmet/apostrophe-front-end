The front-end of Apostrophe is a React application utilizing Redux, React Router, and Redux Thunk.

This project is still underway! Visit this link for a preview of the index page: http://chrismetzger.site/photos/apostrophe.png

To check it out in its current form, follow these instructions:

1) Visit this repo for how to get Apostrophe/s back-end hosted on your local server: https://github.com/critsmet/apostrophe-back-end

2) Fork and clone this respository, 'run npm install', and then 'npm start'. If you use yarn I'm sure you already know what to do.

3) Watch it fire up and think about how great it's gonna be once I get all the buttons working!
